# Smooth UI

Smooth UI is a style system / UI library for [React](https://reactjs.org/). It works with [Styled Components 💅](https://www.styled-components.com) or [Emotion 👩‍🎤](https://emotion.sh/).

It is focused on developer experience, productivity. You can focus on what you want to build instead of on how to build it.
